## 📚 How to Use This Repository

### For Learning:
1. **Start with the theory:** Open the `.md` file to understand the algorithm's concept, complexity, and use cases
2. **Study the implementation:** Review the `.py` file to see how the algorithm is coded
3. **Practice:** Modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding
4. **Test your knowledge:** Try implementing the algorithm from scratch before looking at the solution

### For Quick Reference:
- Use the folder structure to quickly navigate to specific algorithms
- Each `.md` file contains complexity analysis and key insights
- The `.py` files serve as ready-to-use implementations for contests

## 🎓 Learning Path for Beginners

If you're new to competitive programming, follow this suggested learning order:

### Phase 1: Fundamentals
1. **Basic Math** - Number theory, modular arithmetic
2. **Sorting & Searching** - Binary search, merge sort, quick sort
3. **Two Pointers** - Sliding window, array manipulation

### Phase 2: Core Algorithms
1. **Dynamic Programming** - Knapsack, LIS, edit distance
2. **Graph Algorithms** - DFS, BFS, shortest paths
3. **Greedy Algorithms** - Activity selection, Huffman coding

### Phase 3: Advanced Topics
1. **String Algorithms** - KMP, Z-algorithm, suffix arrays
2. **Advanced Data Structures** - Segment trees, Fenwick trees
3. **Network Flow** - Max flow, min cost flow

## 🛠 Running the Code

Each Python file can be executed independently:

```bash
# Navigate to the specific algorithm
cd graph-algorithms/depth-first-search

# Run the implementation
python depth-first-search.py

# Or run with custom input
python depth-first-search.py < input.txt
```
