# The Euclidean Algorithm for GCD: Detailed Explanation and Python Implementation

## Definition and Properties of GCD

- The **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of two non-negative integers $a$ and $b$, denoted $\gcd(a, b)$, is the largest positive integer that divides both $a$ and $b$ without leaving a remainder.
- **Mathematical Definition:**
  $$
  \gcd(a, b) = \max \{ k > 0 : (k \mid a) \text{ and } (k \mid b) \}
  $$
  where "$k \mid a$" means "k divides a".

**Special Cases:**
- If one number is zero and the other is nonzero, $\gcd(a, 0) = |a|$.
- By convention, $\gcd(0, 0) = 0$.

**Associativity:**
- GCD is associative: $\gcd(a, b, c) = \gcd(a, \gcd(b, c))$.

## Algorithm Explanation

### 1. Original Formulation (Repeated Subtraction)
- Subtract the smaller number from the larger repeatedly until one number becomes zero.
- The last nonzero number is the GCD.

### 2. Optimized Formulation (Modulo Operation)
- Replace repeated subtraction with the modulo operation for efficiency.
- **Key property:** $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a \bmod b)$.
- **Recursive Definition:**
  $$
  \gcd(a, b) = 
  \begin{cases}
    a, & \text{if } b = 0 \\
    \gcd(b, a \bmod b), & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$

## Python Implementations

### Recursive Implementation

```python
def gcd_recursive(a, b):
    """
    Calculates the GCD of two non-negative integers using recursion.
    """
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd_recursive(b, a % b)

# Example Usage
print(f"GCD(48, 18) = {gcd_recursive(48, 18)}")       # Output: 6
print(f"GCD(101, 103) = {gcd_recursive(101, 103)}")   # Output: 1
print(f"GCD(15, 0) = {gcd_recursive(15, 0)}")         # Output: 15
print(f"GCD(0, 0) = {gcd_recursive(0, 0)}")           # Output: 0
```
- This directly follows the mathematical definition and is concise.

### Iterative Implementation

```python
def gcd_iterative(a, b):
    """
    Calculates the GCD of two non-negative integers using iteration.
    """
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Example Usage
print(f"GCD(48, 18) = {gcd_iterative(48, 18)}")       # Output: 6
print(f"GCD(101, 103) = {gcd_iterative(101, 103)}")   # Output: 1
print(f"GCD(15, 0) = {gcd_iterative(15, 0)}")         # Output: 15
print(f"GCD(0, 0) = {gcd_iterative(0, 0)}")           # Output: 0
```
- The iterative version avoids recursion overhead and is preferred for very large numbers.

### Step-by-Step Example (Iterative Algorithm)

Let's compute $\gcd(48, 18)$:

| Step | $a$ | $b$ | $a \bmod b$ | New $a$ | New $b$ |
|------|-----|-----|-------------|---------|---------|
| 1    | 48  | 18  | 12          | 18      | 12      |
| 2    | 18  | 12  | 6           | 12      | 6       |
| 3    | 12  | 6   | 0           | 6       | 0       |

Result: $\gcd(48, 18) = 6$.

### Verbose Version with Steps

```python
def gcd_verbose(a, b):
    """
    Prints each step of the Euclidean algorithm.
    """
    while b != 0:
        print(f"{a} = {a // b} * {b} + {a % b}")
        a, b = b, a % b
    print(f"The GCD is {a}")
    return a

# Example
gcd_verbose(48, 18)
```
- This version is useful for educational purposes and debugging.

## Time Complexity

- **Euclidean Algorithm:** $O(\log \min(a, b))$
  - Each step reduces the size of the numbers rapidly.
  - **Lam√©'s Theorem:** The worst case occurs when the inputs are consecutive Fibonacci numbers, confirming the logarithmic bound.

## Least Common Multiple (LCM) via GCD

- The LCM of two numbers can be computed using the GCD:
  $$
  \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{\gcd(a, b)}
  $$

**Python Implementation:**
```python
def lcm(a, b):
    """
    Calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two non-negative integers.
    """
    if a == 0 or b == 0:
        return 0
    return abs(a * b) // gcd_iterative(a, b)

# Example Usage
print(f"LCM(12, 18) = {lcm(12, 18)}")   # Output: 36
print(f"LCM(0, 5) = {lcm(0, 5)}")       # Output: 0
```

## Binary GCD (Stein's Algorithm) [Brief Mention]

- An alternative to the standard Euclidean algorithm, using only subtraction and bitwise operations (no division/modulo).
- Useful in environments where modulo is expensive, but less common in practice due to highly optimized standard algorithms.
